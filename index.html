    <p>
      Fidelity won't always be an easy game to play <br />
There will be times you reconsider why you chose this way <br />
You may feel frightened, might lose hope, may even lose your life, <br />
But don't you think that those you love are worth the sacrifice?
    </p>
    <p>
      Doubt will try to hinder you from sticking by their side <br />
      Self-protection will look like an easy alibi <br />
      It won't be easy to hold to the truths you know are right <br />
      Do you dare to keep your cause and stay here through the night?
    </p>
    <p>
      For there's a joy that one receives when loyalty is proved <br />
      Never giving up the fight, refusing to be moved <br />
      All because you made a pledge; unspoken fealty's due <br />
      To family, country, king, and friendsâ€” this isn't about you.
